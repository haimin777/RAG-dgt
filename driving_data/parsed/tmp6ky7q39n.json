  "question": "When you cannot go forward, nor turn or change direction, how much distance can you travel reversing?",
  "options": [
    "A) A maximum of 25 metres.",
    "B) The least necessary.",
    "C) A maximum of 10 metres."
  ],
  "correct": "B",
  "explanation": "In situations where you cannot proceed forward or change direction, reversing is permitted but should be limited to the minimum distance necessary to safely resolve the issue. Reversing any further than required increases the risk of accidents, as it is a maneuver that reduces visibility and control. There are no fixed maximum distances like 10 or 25 meters specified for this scenario; the key is to reverse only as much as absolutely needed.",
