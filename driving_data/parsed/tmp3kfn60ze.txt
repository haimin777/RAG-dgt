Question: In built-up areas, when the road has more than one lane going in the same direction, a motorcycle may travel...

A) on the right-hand lane and use the lane on the left to change course only.
B) on the lane that better suits its destination.
C) on the right-hand lane only.

Correct answer: B

Explanation:
According to Spanish traffic regulations (DGT), in built-up (urban) areas, on roads with multiple lanes in the same direction, all vehicles, including motorcycles, may travel in the lane that best suits their destination. This helps drivers position themselves in advance for turns, exits, or other maneuvers, improving safety and traffic flow. However, lane changes must be done safely and with proper signaling.

Sign: The image shows several road signs, including a circular speed limit sign of 20 km/h, a triangular yield sign, and a blue circular sign indicating an obligatory pedestrian path.
