Question: Which of the following accessories does the driver of a sedan have to carry?

A) A fire extinguisher.
B) Two devices for danger pre-signalling.
C) A can of oil.

Correct answer: B

Explanation:
In Spain, according to DGT regulations for Permiso B vehicles like sedans, drivers must carry two portable warning devices (such as triangles) for pre-signalling danger in case of a breakdown or accident. A fire extinguisher is not mandatory for private passenger cars, though it is recommended. A can of oil is not a required item by law.
