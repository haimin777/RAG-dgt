  ],
  "correct": "B",
  "explanation": "According to Spanish traffic regulations (DGT), in built-up (urban) areas, on roads with multiple lanes in the same direction, all vehicles, including motorcycles, may travel in the lane that best suits their destination. This helps drivers position themselves in advance for turns, exits, or other maneuvers, improving safety and traffic flow. However, lane changes must be done safely and with proper signaling.",
