Question: Which lights must be used in dust or smoke clouds during the day?

A) The parking lights.
B) During the day, none.
C) The front anti-fog lights or the dipped or high-beam headlights.

Correct answer: C

Explanation:
In Spain, according to DGT regulations, when driving through dust or smoke clouds that reduce visibility during the day, you must use the front fog lights if available, or the dipped beam headlights. High-beam headlights may be used if they do not dazzle other drivers and visibility requires it. Parking lights are not sufficient for these conditions, and driving without lights is not allowed as it compromises safety and visibility to other road users.

Sign: A small road sign is visible on the right side of the road, but its details are obscured by the dust cloud in the image.
